The source code in this directory was done in Python 2.7.15
Analysis was done using the latest version of scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library. For attribution purposes, articles required by scikit-learn are cited:

Scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python, Pedregosa et al., JMLR 12, pp. 2825-2830, 2011.
API design for machine learning software: experiences from the scikit-learn project, Buitinck et al., 2013.

Installation:
To run the code in this project, make sure you have matplotlib, numpy, sklearn, and scipy installed

Top level folder overview:
There is only one folder which contains all the codes and csv datafiles.

Supervised Learning.ipynb - Jupyter notebook containing all the code needed to run analyses/experiments on both the datasets
CreditCardDefaultData.csv - Credit Card default data in csv format
BankMarketingData.csv - Bank Marketing Data in csv format
rsingh334-analysis.pdf - contains the written report derived from the performed analyses/experiments

How to use:
- The code contains commented headers which describe what each section of comments does, be it KNN analysis looking for k, or Neural Networks
- Simply uncomment the section of code you'd like to run, corresponding to an analysis, and run the python file

How to run a Python file:
- on Windows: python "filename".py - with no quotations
- on Mac: python3 "filename".py - with no quotations

To uncomment the necessary code in the source files (it will look like below):
 '''code
	code
	code
	code'''
	
Simply remove the three apostrophes (or single quotes) on both ends to uncomment a section of code
